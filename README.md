# Daily Data Analytics

Hello, fellow data analysts!

I've decided that I want to apply to Epic Systems for a data analytics position. I have one year to prepare...

I will upload one "project" every day for a year to track my progress as I learn about SQL, SQL Server database administration, SSIS for ETL processes, and Powershell development. As of now, I barely know what any of those words mean. But I am determined. My hope is that uploading daily to this repository will keep me accountable as I race towards my goals.

So, without further ado, let us commence the journey from zero to... epic!
